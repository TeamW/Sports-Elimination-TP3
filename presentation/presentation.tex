  \frametitle{Project outline}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> Aim of the project is to implement an algorithm that
  will be able to say that a team X cannot win the Baseball league.
  % Based on schedule of remaining games and current standings.
  \item<3-> Ford-Fulkerson algorithm used.
  % Briefly describe it (?)
  \item<4-> A team X is only eliminated if there is no mathematically possible
  way for X to finish top of the league.
  \item<5-> Builds on na\"{\i}ve calculations made by sports pundits.
  \item<6-> Real world application of Graph Theory.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> Revolves around creation of graphs and the flow along them.
  \item<3-> Currently can create all graphs and pushes flow along a particular 
  graph.
  \item<4-> Pushing flow through the graph will allow us to determine if the
  given team X is eliminated from the league.
  \item<5-> A team X can win the league if it is possible for there to be a
  saturating flow. A flow is saturated if the total flow from the source equals
  the total capacity from the source.
  \item<6-> All flow leaving the source has to arrive at the sink.
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Parser}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Currently Parsing a simple .txt file 
  
 \item<2-> Contains all the results from both the National \& American League for the East, Central and West Divisions for 2001 season. 
 \item<3-> Uses basic string comparison to put the relevant team in the correct League and Division. This is Hard coded into the parser. 
 
  \item<4-> Have considered future plans to parse a web page. Be done by looking at the Html of the page, and extracting the relevant data. 
\item<5->Finding the correct page has been proving problematic.
\item<6-> As a team we are unsure if we would like to implement this feature or concentrate our energies on other features.
\item<6->  I.E Making the App web based.

\frame{
  \frametitle{User Interface}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Simple design based on presenting key information immediately.
  \item<2-> More detailed information avaliable on user request.
  \item<3-> Challenge is to integrate the two tasks such that the UI is 
  both functionally and aesthetically pleasing.
  \end{itemize}
}
\frame{
  \frametitle{User Interface - Key Tasks}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Display all teams by division, league or elimination status.
  \item<2-> Update the elimination status on startup, as well as on week changes.
  \item<3-> Display certification of elimination of teams eliminated.
  \end{itemize}
}
\frame{
  \frametitle{User Interface - Secondary Tasks}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> View upcoming matches on a week-by-week schedule.
  \item<2-> Display more detailed information about a selected team (game stats,
  WL percentage etc).
  \item<3-> Step through the season week by week, allowing skips to key events
  such as first and last elimination.
  \end{itemize}
}
\frame{
  \frametitle{User Interface - Prototype}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Team quickly decided that a UI prototype should be implemented early
on in the process.
  \item<2-> Initial prototype only supports stubbed version of key tasks.
  \item<3-> Allows us to see how practical design choices are and keep up with any
changes in the parsing/algorithmic side of development.
  \item<4-> Future UI will likely be built on these initial foundations. This iterative 
approach allows for a fluid and adaptive process.
  \end{itemize}
