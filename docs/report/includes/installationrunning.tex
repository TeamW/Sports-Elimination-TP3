\section{Desktop Application}

\subsection{Installation}

The desktop application requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) available 
from \url{http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp}. The application has been 
tested on JRE 6 and JRE 7 without issue.

The print functionality requires a LaTeX distribution that includes the
executable `pdflatex'. The installation procedure varies for each operating
system and instructions are available from
\url{http://latex-project.org/ftp.html}.

\subsection{Running}

After the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed, running the application
only requires double clicking the supplied JAR file.

The print functionality is executed within the Java application and thus is
transparent to the user. In the event that the command `pdflatex' cannot be
found, the application will fail to print however will not crash. Print
functionality is known to work on standard installations of the distribution
on Linux/GNU-based and Mac OS operating system.

\section{Web Application}

\subsection{Installation}

Installation of the web application is not required as a remote host is running
the required software. This can be accessed via 
\url{http://www.gordonrenfrewshire.com/teamw}. For purposes of completeness
and satisfying the potential desires of the reader, an installation procedure
is supplied.

The web server has numerous standard applications running to service the web
application. Each one is required for full functionality:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A web server (such as Lighttpd or Apache)
\item PHP (known to work on PHP 5.x)
\item Java Runtime Environment (version 6 or 7)
\item MySQL (version 5.x)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Installation of packages}

distribution. The official procedure for installation of a `LAMP' (Linux
Apache, MySQL, PHP) server is available from the Debian Wiki at
\url{http://wiki.debian.org/LaMp}

the default are highly recommended.

A word of warning, the variable scope is very insecure and however was designed
as such for simplicity of installation and testing. Please do not run the server
code on a public or production server.
