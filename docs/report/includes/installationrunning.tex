\subsection{Desktop Application}

\subsubsection{Installation}

The desktop application requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) available 
from \url{http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp}. The application has been 
tested on JRE 6 and JRE 7 without issue.

The print functionality requires a LaTeX distribution that includes the
executable `pdflatex'. The installation procedure varies for each operating
system and instructions are available from
\url{http://latex-project.org/ftp.html}.

\subsubsection{Running}

After the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed, running the application
only requires double clicking the supplied JAR file.

The print functionality is executed within the Java application and thus is
transparent to the user. In the event that the command `pdflatex' cannot be
found, the application will fail to print however will not crash. Print
functionality is known to work on standard installations of the distribution
on Linux/GNU-based and Mac OS operating system.
