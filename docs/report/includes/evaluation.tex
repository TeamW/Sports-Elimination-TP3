\section{User Evaluation }

\subsubsection{Introduction}

After completing the implementation of the desktop and web based applications a thorough user evaluation was carried out of both systems. The user evaluation functioned as a reliable way to test the usability and likeability of both system designs. All usability testing preformed by the team was done in accordance with the University of Glasgow ethics procedures. The Evaluation was preformed in a three stage process. 


\subsubsection{ Participant Brief }

Starting with an introductory briefing, the team member conducting the evaluation introduced the test participant to the system, provided the user with a test number and a copy of the user test script and described the aims of the user evaluation that was about to take place.  

During this stage the participant was asked to answer a few simple questions to gauge their competency using desktop and web based applications, and to gauge their personal interest in the systems domain -sports statistics- .

 During the introductory brief, it was made clear to the participant that no personal or identifying information would be collected from them during the user evaluation.  It was decided by the team that this would hopefully decrease the amount of participants who would not complete the evaluation fully and to ease the process of gaining eithical permissions from the university . Due to the fact that no test particapnts decided to stop the evalation half way through , and gaining ethical approval for the user evaluation was a simple process it was felt like this was a benifical desion . 

In accordance with the universitys ethical prodedures during the introductory breifing the test participant were reminded of their right to stop the evalution at any time with no requirement to give reason. The user was then further reminded that it was not them, but the system that was under evaluation, and the user was provided with the contact details of the team member conducting the evaluation. to allow the user to contact the team to answer any question or after thoughts that they had about the system or the user evaluation after it had been completed and they had some time to think on the process .

\subsubsection{Think-Aloud (usability) }

The evaluation was performed using the ”Think-Aloud” technique  which consists of participants performing a series of tasks set out to provide a complete overview of the full functionality provided by both the web based and desktop based Applications. 

The test participants were encouraged to talk out loud as they preformed a series of tasks, designed to provide a full overview of the complete functionality provided by both systems 

At this stage the role of the team member conducting the evaluation was to take note of any hesitation shown by the test candidate, possible confusion, or errors encountered when using the system. The reactions shown by the test participant when interacting with both the web based and desktop based Applications would clearly highlight usability problems which have went unseen in the teams initial systems design.
