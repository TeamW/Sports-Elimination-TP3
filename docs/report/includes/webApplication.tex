\subsection{Design}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

This section discusses the design of the web-based version of the application.
The design of the application was constructed with only the most important
functional and non-functional requirements in mind. The web-based version was
classed as the least important part of the project, with preliminary effort
directed solely towards the desktop application.

\subsubsection{System architecture}

The web application is a standard multi-tier architecture with the presentation,
logic, and data separated from each other.

The presentation tier is the client/browser who has Hyper Text Markup Language
(HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for the static presentation of content.
In addition there is Javascript supported by JQuery JQueryUI for the dynamic
user interface elements.

The logic tier runs on a web server called Lighttpd (pronounced lighty) that is
supported by PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The logic tier has two data
sources, a MySQL database containing the latest data and a Java jar for looking
back at older data.
