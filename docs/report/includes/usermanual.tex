\section{Installing \& Starting}
\subsection{Desktop Application}

The desktop application requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) available from \url{http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp}. The application has been tested on JRE 6 and JRE 7 without issue. The print functionality requires a LaTeX distribution that includes the executable `pdflatex'. The installation procedure varies for each operating system and instructions are available from \url{http://latex-project.org/ftp.html}.

After the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed, running the application only requires double clicking the supplied JAR file.

The print functionality is executed within the Java application and thus is transparent to the user. In the event that the command `pdflatex' cannot be found, the application will fail to print however will not crash. Print functionality is known to work on standard installations of the distribution on Linux/GNU-based and Mac OS operating system.

\subsection{Web Application}

Installation of the web application is not required as a remote host is running the required software. This can be accessed via \url{http://www.gordonrenfrewshire.com/teamw}. For purposes of completeness and satisfying the potential desires of the reader, an installation procedure is supplied.

In the event that the supplied URL fails to work, please contact Gordon Reid via any of the following methods:

\section{Desktop Navigation}

When you first start the application up you'll be shown the screen below.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/userManualDesk1.png}

From here we can see surrounded by the red box at the bottom of the screen the main navigational tool traversing to different dates within the season. We always start at the most up to date standings in this case the end of season results. Instantly we're able to see the date and time displayed at the top and just below this we're able to see the standings for the particular selected League and Division in this case National West.

In the above screenshot the date has been easily changed using the drop down menu's available and the points of each of the displayed teams has changed to represent the change in date.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/userManualDesk3.png}

Changing the League and Division radio buttons will show you the specified teams and should a team be non-trivially eliminated which means even if it played and won all it's remaining it games, it still wouldn't be able to take first position, then it'll be displayed as shown, above the date navigation.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/userManualDesk4.png}

If you click on one of the checked boxes available specifying that a team has been eliminated, it will you show the certificate of elimination - which team was responsible for it's elimination, or if it wasn't a team, the fact that they're not top when the season has finished as shown below.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/userManualDesk5.png}

If we change the date and league and click on a team this time we're able to see the elimination as consequence of another team.

\section{Importing}

The import functionality within the program allows user specified seasons to be used in the system directly if they wish to analyse future or prior seasons, they need only follow the formatting conventions used in the original source and when they're prompted to select a file they select a suitable file the application will calculate and generate the appropriate results up to whatever date the users file goes up to.

\section{Exporting}

The export functionality with the application allows users to create a PDF file with chosen days to display. To begin navigate to the file menu and down to print and if you select "Add to print", the program will add the current day you're on to the printing queue.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/userManualDesk9.png}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/userManualDesk10.png}

If you select any number of more dates by navigating however you wish and adding them one at a time you can then view your print queue and it will show you the days you wish to export to the PDF.

Finally you can either clear your print queue by selecting "Clear document", or to export your selected results to the PDF simply click "Print"

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/userManualDesk13.png}

You'll be prompted to select a name for your pdf file in a dialog box and a location to save it and then by clicking save your PDF will be compiled ready for viewing at the specified location.

As we can see below it creates a neatly formatted PDF file of your chosen results for use outside of the program, showing to others and easily transferable.

\section{Web Navigation}

When you first go to the URL specified in the installation chapter you'll be shown this screen.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/userManualWeb1.png}

Each of the leagues and divisions are clearly visible and if you click on one of the emboldened headings the standings will pop out below.

To navigate between different days you can use the previous/next day buttons above the leagues and divisions.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/userManualWeb3.png}

This method is however very time consuming so instead it would be advised that you change the date using the URL itself

Finally if you'd like to jump back to the latest results in a given season you can click the button in the small side navigation bar.
