\subsection{Design}
In designing the desktop user interface the first step was to identify the
main goals of our users, in order to make sure that the system delivered
the required information quickly and clearly. After a discussion it was 
agreed that the typical user would have two main priorities - checking 
whether a specific team had been elimated and viewing the league tables for
each division. This was further broken down into a list of functional requirements.

\begin{itemize}
\item Display eliminated teams.
\item Display all divisions/leagues.
\item Display all teams in a division.
\item Automatically update the display on startup.
\item Display certificate of elimination.
\end{itemize}

With these requirements in mind several paper prototypes were
created by different members of the team so as to increase the range of
ideas we could incorporate into the final design. These prototypes were
compared in terms of functional clarity and aesthetic appeal, with the 
effective elements of each taken and incorporated into a final prototype
design. (IMAGE OF PROTOTYPE HERE).
