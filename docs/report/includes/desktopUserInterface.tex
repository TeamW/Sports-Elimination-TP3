\subsection{Design}
In designing the desktop user interface the first step was to identify the
main goals of our users, in order to make sure that the system delivered
the required information quickly and clearly. After a discussion it was 
agreed that the typical user would have two main priorities - checking 
whether a specific team had been elimated and viewing the league tables for
each division. With this in mind several different paper prototypes were
created by different members of the team so as to increase the range of
ideas we could incorporate into the final design. These prototypes were
compared in terms of functional clarity and aesthetic appeal, with the 
effective elements of each taken and incorporated into a final prototype
design. (IMAGE OF PROTOTYPE HERE)
