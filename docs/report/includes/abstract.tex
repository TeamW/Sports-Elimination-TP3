The project objective is to solve the sports elimination question for Baseball.
The primary aim of the project is to implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
that, given a league table, remaining schedule of matches, and a team, will
determine whether or not the given team has a chance of finishing at the top of
the league table. The results will then be displayed on a user interface. The
user interface also allows the user to navigate between weeks to see how the
league progressed and when teams were first eliminated.
