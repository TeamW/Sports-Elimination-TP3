I would like to talk about the web application first off.

From the beginning of the second semester, the desktop application was largely
complete. I had been personally interested in having a web based application
and since there was a completed desktop version, this freed up the team to look
at other avenues, such as the web application.

The web application contains a subset of the most important functionality of
the desktop application: Viewing all divisions with elimination information and
moving through dates in the league.

The web application was a challenging part of the project with multiple
languages and applications involved to host and deliver content over the
Internet.

A major section of the project's future work is to add more of the desktop
functionality to the web application, including a date selector and downloadable
PDF of divisions, and to provide a more efficient method for generating
data from earlier in the league.

I would now like to show you a screen-shot of the web application...

The web application was designed to have a clean, clear layout with the as much
of the information `above the fold' of the page as possible. To ensure that this
is the case as, each table is initially hidden. Clicking the division name shows
the table information. This is similar to the desktop user interface with its
radio button selectors. The information displayed is stored in a database for
quick access of the most up to date information.

The `Previous Day' and 'Next Day' links allow the user to move through the
division information day-by-day. Information from earlier dates is generated on
demand from a jar file. The user can skip back to the most recent information by
using the link at the right hand side.

As mentioned before, the web application is a major part of the future work and
the aim is to add as much of the functionality of the desktop user interface
as possible.
