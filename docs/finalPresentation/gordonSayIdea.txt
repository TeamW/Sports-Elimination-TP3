I would like to talk about the web application first off.

From the beginning of the second semester, the desktop application was largely
complete. I had been personally interested in having a web based application
and since there was a completed desktop version, this freed up the team to look
at other avenues, such as the web application.

The web application contains a subset of the most important functionality of
the desktop application: Viewing all divisions with elimination information and
moving through dates in the league.

The web application was a challenging part of the project with multiple
languages and applications involved to host and deliver content over the
Internet.

A major section of the project's future work is to add more of the desktop
functionality to the web application, including a date selector and downloadable
PDF of divisions.

I would now like to show you a screen-shot of the web application...

The web application was designed to have a clean, clear layout with the as
much of the information `above the fold' of the page as possible.
