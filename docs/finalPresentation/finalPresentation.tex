  \frametitle{Project introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Project aims to answer sports elimination question.
  \item What is sports elimination?
  \item Main modules: Parsing, Desktop/Web User Interface, Algorithm, User Evaluation
  \item Builds on na\"{\i}ve calculations made by sports pundits.
  \end{itemize}
}
\frame{
  \frametitle{Sport}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item American Major League Baseball.
  \item 1 point for a win, 0 points for a loss, no draws allowed.
  \item Six divisions with four to six teams per division.
  \end{itemize}
}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> Uses basic string comparison to put the relevant team in the
  correct League and Division.
  \item<3-> Have considered future plans to parse a web page.
  \item<4-> Our current source is not suitable for real-time updating.
  \item<5-> As a team we are unsure if we would like to implement this feature
  or concentrate our energies on other features for example, making a web-based
  UI.
  \end{itemize}
}
\frame{
  \frametitle{User Interface}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> User is likely an advanced follower of the sport looking for
  very specific information.
  \item<2-> Simple design based on presenting this key information immediately.
  \item<3-> More detailed information available on user request.
  \item<4-> Challenge is to integrate the two tasks such that the UI is
  both functionally and aesthetically pleasing.
  \end{itemize}
}
\frame{
  \frametitle{User Interface - Key Tasks}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Display all teams by division and league, showing elimination status.
  \item<2-> Update the elimination status on start-up.
  \item<3-> Display certification of elimination for teams eliminated.
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{User Interface - Additional Tasks}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Allow date navigation, displaying correct results for each the date.
  \item<2-> Display print functionality.
  \item<3-> Display league generation functionality.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> An extension of the project.
  \item<2-> Contains a subset of most important functionality of
  desktop application.
  \item<2-> Numerous extensions of web application part of future work.

  \frametitle{Algorithm}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> Revolves around creation of directed graphs and flow
    through directed graphs.
  \item<3-> Pushing flow through a specific graph will allow us to
    determine if the given team X is eliminated from a given league.
  \item<4-> A team X can win the league if it is possible for there to
    be a saturating flow. A flow is saturated if the total flow from
    the source equals the total capacity from the source.
  \item<5-> All flow leaving the source has to arrive at the sink.

  \item $team_i$ and $team_j$ - Arbitrary teams in $team_k$'s division
  \item $g_{i, j}$ - Number of games left between $team_i$ and $team_j$
  \item W - Current score of $team_k$ + games $team_k$ has remaining
  \item $w_{i}$ - Number of game $team_i$ won

  \frametitle{Algorithm - Extensions}

\frametitle{ User Evaluation }

Aim : Gain quality feedback regarding the useability of the system we created.

Structure :

\begin{itemize}

\item<1->Stage 1 : Participant Breif. ( Intro )
\item<2->Stage 2 : Task Script ( Useability )
\item<3->Stage 3 : Questionare ( Likeability )
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Supprizes ! }

Lots of intersting Lessons Learned !

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Gained tangible results very quickly.
\item<2-> Design faults tripped up even the most experienced of users.
\item<3->Very wide variety of attention span in test group .
\item<4-> User's got tripped up by testing method .
\end{itemize}
}
\frame{
\frametitle{Varied and Quality Feedback : Examples }

Overall User Evaluation was very sucessfull. Gained a diverse range of quality feedback from test subjects. Discovered Bugs, Usability Issues and Design Flaws - Highlight the value of User Testing.
 
\begin{itemize}

\item<1-> Design Flaws : Radio Button for League and Division selection .


\item<2->Usability Issues : Inadeqet Documentation provided at time of testing/ Missed Functionality !  .
\item<3-> Bugs : Date not being displayed on loading of Web application .
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Over Very Positive Feedback!}

System received numerous positive comments on useability and asthetic.

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Diverse range of feedback gained highlighted value of thorough user testing !
\item<2-> Provided great ideas for future work, design improvements, tweaks . . etc
\item<3-> Lots of users interested in the system, even if had no interest in the domain.
\end{itemize}
